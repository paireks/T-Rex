## Purpose

T-Rex can help you to create 3D models of reinforced concrete structures with Grasshopper (Rhino 6).

## How it works?

Basically T-Rex can help you to model different rebars, which are represented by meshes, which allows real-time generation of model even for thousands of bars.

## About the code

Code is not designed to be used outside Grasshopper environment.

xUnit library was used to unit-test the project.

Brontosaurus plug-in was used to create automatic tests inside Grasshopper.
